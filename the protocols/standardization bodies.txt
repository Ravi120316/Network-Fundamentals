# The Standardization Bodies

In computer networking, **standardization bodies** are organizations responsible for developing and maintaining rules, protocols, and standards.  
These standards ensure **interoperability, compatibility, and reliability** among devices, applications, and networks worldwide.

## Major Standardization Bodies

1. **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**  
   - Developed the **OSI Reference Model**.  
   - Provides a framework for network architecture.  

2. **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**  
   - Defines LAN and MAN standards.  
   - Example: IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).  

3. **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**  
   - Develops standards for Internet protocols (TCP/IP suite).  
   - Example: HTTP, SMTP, DNS.  

4. **ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union â€“ Telecommunication Standardization Sector)**  
   - Creates standards for telecommunication and networking.  
   - Example: Telephone systems, broadband technologies.  

5. **ANSI (American National Standards Institute)**  
   - Coordinates U.S. standards.  
   - Example: ASCII character encoding.  

6. **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**  
   - Focuses on web technologies.  
   - Example: HTML, CSS, XML.  

7. **ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)**  
   - Defines standards for European telecommunication.  
   - Example: GSM (Global System for Mobile communication).
