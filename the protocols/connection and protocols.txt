# Connections and Protocols

## 1. Connections
A **connection** is the link established between two or more devices to enable communication.  
Connections can be **physical** (wired cables, Wi-Fi signals) or **logical** (software-level paths).  

### Types of Connections:
1. **Connection-Oriented**
   - Requires a dedicated connection before data transfer.
   - Reliable and maintains order of packets.
   - Example: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.

2. **Connectionless**
   - No dedicated connection is established.
   - Faster but less reliable (packet loss possible).
   - Example: **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**.

## 2. Protocols
A **protocol** is a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network.  
Without protocols, devices would not understand each other’s communication.  

### Common Protocols:
- **TCP/IP** → Foundation of the Internet.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** → For web communication.  
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** → For file transfers.  
- **SMTP / POP3 / IMAP** → For email services.  
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** → Converts domain names into IP addresses.

## Relationship Between Connections and Protocols
- **Connection** defines how the link is established (oriented or connectionless).  
- **Protocol** defines the rules and format of communication.  
- Together, they ensure smooth and standardized data exchange.
