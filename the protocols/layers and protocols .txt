# Layers and Protocols

## What are Layers?
- A **Layer** is a level in the network architecture where specific tasks of communication are performed.
- Each layer is responsible for a particular function (e.g., error control, routing, encryption).
- Layers make the design **modular**, simplifying understanding, development, and troubleshooting.

## What are Protocols?
- A **Protocol** is a set of rules that governs how communication takes place between devices within a layer.
- It defines **formats, timing, sequencing, and error control** for data exchange.

## Relation Between Layers and Protocols
- Each layer performs its function using one or more protocols.
- Layers provide services to the layer above and use the services of the layer below.
- **Example:**
  - **Transport Layer** uses **TCP** (reliable) or **UDP** (fast, connectionless).
  - **Network Layer** uses **IP** for routing packets.

## Benefits of Using Layers and Protocols
1. **Modularity** – Easier design and management.  
2. **Interoperability** – Devices from different vendors can work together if they use the same protocols.  
3. **Scalability** – New technologies can be integrated without redesigning the entire system.
