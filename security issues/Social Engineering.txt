## Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Phishing**
   - Fake emails or websites trick users into sharing login or financial information.  
   - Example: “Your bank account is locked, click here to verify.”  

2. **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**
   - Attackers impersonate trusted people on phone calls to steal information.  
   - Example: Fake bank calls asking for OTP.  

3. **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**
   - Fraudulent SMS messages with malicious links.  

4. **Pretexting**
   - Attackers create a fake story or reason to extract information.  
   - Example: Impersonating IT support staff to ask for passwords.  

5. **Baiting**
   - Offering free/attractive items (e.g., infected USB drive, free downloads) to lure victims.  

6. **Tailgating / Piggybacking**
   - Gaining unauthorized physical access by following authorized personnel.

## Conclusion
Social engineering attacks target **human weaknesses** rather than technology.  
The best defense is a combination of **user awareness and strong authentication practices**.
