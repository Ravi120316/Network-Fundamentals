# Network Categories: Division Based on Communication Types

Networks can be classified based on how communication occurs between devices.

## 1. Unicast Communication
- **Definition:** One sender communicates with one receiver
- **Characteristics:** One-to-one, efficient for private data transfer
- **Example:** Sending an email to one person, file transfer between two PCs

## 2. Broadcast Communication
- **Definition:** One sender communicates with all devices in the network
- **Characteristics:** One-to-all, all devices receive data, may cause unnecessary traffic
- **Example:** ARP request, TV/Radio broadcasting

## 3. Multicast Communication
- **Definition:** One sender communicates with a specific group of receivers
- **Characteristics:** One-to-many, more efficient than broadcast, used in group communication
- **Example:** Online video streaming (live sports), video conferencing

## 4. Anycast Communication (Advanced)
- **Definition:** One sender communicates with the nearest receiver among multiple receivers
- **Characteristics:** One-to-nearest, improves performance and reduces latency
- **Example:** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), DNS queries
