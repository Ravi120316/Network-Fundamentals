# Network Categories: Division Based on Connection (Including MANETs & Sensor Networks)

Networks can be classified based on how devices are connected.

## 1. Wired Network
- **Definition:** Devices connected using physical cables (Ethernet, coaxial, fiber optic)
- **Characteristics:** Reliable, stable, high speed, low latency, less interference
- **Example:** Office LAN using Ethernet cables

## 2. Wireless Network
- **Definition:** Devices connected without cables using radio waves, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared, microwave
- **Characteristics:** Flexible, mobile, easy to install, slightly slower, prone to interference
- **Example:** Home Wi-Fi, Bluetooth headphones

## 3. MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Network) 
- **Definition:** Wireless, self-configuring network of mobile devices without fixed infrastructure
- **Characteristics:** Devices act as hosts and routers, dynamic topology, used in emergency and military applications
- **Example:** Network of smartphones in a disaster area, battlefield communication

## 4. Sensor Network 
- **Definition:** Network of spatially distributed sensors to monitor environmental or physical conditions
- **Characteristics:** Collects data like temperature, pressure, or motion; wireless and low-power devices; data sent to central system for analysis
- **Example:** Smart agriculture sensors, home security sensors
