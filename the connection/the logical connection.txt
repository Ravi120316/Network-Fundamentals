# Logical Connection

A **Logical Connection** defines how devices in a network communicate with each other at a logical level, regardless of the physical medium (wired/wireless).  
It represents the **path and rules** for data flow between devices.

---

## 1. Point-to-Point Logical Connection
- A direct logical path exists between two devices.
- Data is exchanged only between the sender and receiver.
- **Example:** Computer ↔ Printer connection.

---

## 2. Broadcast Logical Connection
- A message sent by one device is delivered to **all devices** in the network.
- Useful for announcements or discovery protocols.
- **Example:** ARP request in a LAN.

---

## 3. Multipoint / Multicast Logical Connection
- A message is delivered to a **specific group of devices**, not to everyone.
- Efficient for applications where the same data must reach multiple receivers.
- **Example:** Online video streaming to a selected group of users.

## Key Difference
- **Physical Connection** → The medium (cables or wireless signals).  
- **Logical Connection** → The logical data path (point-to-point, broadcast, multicast).
