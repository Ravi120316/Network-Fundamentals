# The Physical Connection

The **Physical Connection** in a computer network refers to the medium through which devices are connected to transmit data. It can be established using either **wired** or **wireless** technologies.

## 1. Wired Connections
Devices are connected using physical cables.
- **Twisted Pair Cable** → Commonly used in Ethernet (LANs).
- **Coaxial Cable** → Used in broadband and TV networks.
- **Fiber Optic Cable** → High-speed, long-distance communication.

**Advantages:**
- Fast and reliable
- More secure

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited mobility
- Costly (especially fiber optic)

---

## 2. Wireless Connections
Devices communicate using electromagnetic signals (no cables).
- **Wi-Fi** → Local wireless networking
- **Bluetooth** → Short-distance communication
- **Infrared** → Limited range (e.g., remote controls)
- **Microwave / Satellite** → Long-distance communication

**Advantages:**
- Flexible and mobile
- Easy to install

**Disadvantages:**
- Less secure (prone to interference)
- Generally slower than wired

---

## Summary
- **Physical connection** = How devices are connected in a network.
- **Wired** → Cables (fast, secure, less flexible).
- **Wireless** → Signals (flexible, mobile, less secure).
