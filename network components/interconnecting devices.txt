# Interconnecting Devices

In computer networks, interconnecting devices are used to connect multiple nodes and enable communication between them. They ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and correctly.

---

## 1. Hub
- A basic device that connects multiple devices in a network.
- It broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices.
- **No intelligence** (does not check destination).
- Used in small and simple networks.

---

## 2. Switch
- More intelligent than a hub.
- Forwards data only to the specific device whose **MAC address** matches.
- Reduces collisions and improves efficiency.

---

## 3. Router
- Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN).
- Routes data packets based on **IP addresses**.
- Widely used in internet connections.

---

## 4. Bridge
- Connects two different LANs.
- Forwards data based on **MAC addresses**.

---

## 5. Gateway
- Works as a **translator** between networks using different protocols.
- Allows communication between dissimilar systems.
- Examples: Email gateway, VoIP gateway.

## Summary
- **Hub** → Broadcasts to all devices  
- **Switch** → Sends data to correct device (MAC-based)  
- **Router** → Connects networks (IP-based)  
- **Bridge** → Connects two LANs  
- **Gateway** → Connects networks with different protocols
