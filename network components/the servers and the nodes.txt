# Servers and Nodes

## 1. Nodes
- A **Node** is any device connected to a network that can send, receive, or process data.
- Examples: Computers, printers, switches, routers, smartphones, IoT devices.
- Every connected device in a network is considered a node.

### Example:
In a LAN with 5 computers + 1 printer + 1 switch → Total nodes = 7.

## 2. Servers
- A **Server** is a special type of node that provides services to other nodes (called clients) in a network.
- Servers are usually powerful machines with high processing power and storage.
- **Types of Servers:**
  - **Web Server** → Hosts websites
  - **Mail Server** → Manages emails
  - **File Server** → Stores and shares files
  - **Database Server** → Manages databases

## 3. Relationship between Nodes and Servers
- **All Servers are Nodes, but not all Nodes are Servers.**
- Meaning: Every server is a node (since it is part of the network), but every node is not necessarily a server.
