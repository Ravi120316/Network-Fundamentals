# Cables for Wired Connection

In networking, wired connections use different types of cables to transmit data. These cables carry data as electrical or light signals.

## 1. Twisted Pair Cable
- **Description:** Two insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce interference.
- **Types:**
  - **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Common, inexpensive, widely used in LANs.
  - **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):** Has extra shielding for better protection against interference.
- **Uses:** LAN, telecommunication
- **Speed:** 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps

## 2. Coaxial Cable
- **Description:** Central copper conductor with insulation and metallic shield.
- **Advantages:** Better protection against interference.
- **Uses:** Cable TV, older Ethernet networks
- **Speed:** Up to 10 Mbps

## 3. Fiber Optic Cable
- **Description:** Uses glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as light signals.
- **Advantages:** Very high speed, no electromagnetic interference, supports long distances.
- **Uses:** Internet backbone, long-distance communication, ISPs
- **Speed:** Several Gbps to Tbps

## Summary
- **Twisted Pair:** Cheap, common in LAN
- **Coaxial:** Better shielding, older technology
- **Fiber Optic:** Fastest, modern and long-distance use
