# Quality of Service (QoS) Issues

**Quality of Service (QoS)** refers to the ability of a network to provide reliable, predictable, and efficient communication services.  
QoS defines how well the network performs for applications such as video streaming, VoIP, and online gaming.

---

## Key QoS Parameters
1. **Bandwidth** → Maximum data transfer rate of the network.
2. **Latency (Delay)** → Time taken for data to travel from source to destination.
3. **Jitter** → Variation in packet delay; harmful for real-time applications.
4. **Packet Loss** → Packets dropped during transmission, leading to poor audio/video quality.
5. **Reliability** → Stability and consistency of the network service.

---

## Causes of QoS Issues
- **Network Congestion** → Too many users sharing the same bandwidth.
- **Insufficient Bandwidth Allocation**.
- **Hardware Failures** → Faulty routers, switches, or wireless APs.
- **Unstable Wireless Connections**.
- **Lack of QoS Mechanisms** → No traffic prioritization.

---

## Solutions to QoS Issues
- Implement **Traffic Prioritization** (e.g., give VoIP higher priority than bulk downloads).
- Allocate **sufficient bandwidth** per application.
- Use **Error Detection and Correction** methods.
- Apply **QoS Standards** like:
  - **IntServ (Integrated Services)** → Guarantees bandwidth for specific flows.
  - **DiffServ (Differentiated Services)** → Classifies and prioritizes traffic categories.

---

## Conclusion
QoS issues directly affect **user experience** in modern networks.  
Proper resource allocation, prioritization, and error control are essential for ensuring smooth communication.
