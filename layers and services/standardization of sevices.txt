# Standardization of Services

**Standardization of Services** ensures that network services provided by each layer follow a set of international rules and formats, allowing devices and applications from different vendors to work together seamlessly.

---

## Importance of Standardization
1. **Interoperability** → Devices from different manufacturers can communicate without issues.
2. **Compatibility** → Old and new technologies can coexist and function together.
3. **Scalability** → Networks can grow and expand easily.
4. **Reliability** → Fewer errors as all systems follow the same rules.

---

## Examples of Standards
- **TCP/IP Protocol Suite** → Basis of Internet communication.
- **IEEE 802.11** → Wi-Fi communication standard.
- **IEEE 802.3** → Ethernet (LAN) standard.
- **OSI Reference Model** → Provides a universal layered framework.
- **HTTP, SMTP, FTP** → Standardized application layer services.

---

## Standardization Bodies
- **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** → Designed the OSI model.
- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** → Defines standards for LAN, MAN (e.g., 802 series).
- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)** → Develops Internet standards like TCP/IP.
- **ITU (International Telecommunication Union)** → Responsible for telecommunication standards.

## Conclusion
Without standardization, global networking would not be possible.  
It ensures **uniformity, compatibility, and interoperability** across all types of networks and devices.
